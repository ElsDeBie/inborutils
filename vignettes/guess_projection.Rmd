# Check coordinate system of point data

## Introduction

When retrieving a number of data-points, but the kind of projection is not provided/known (for any reason), this utility plots the data for different projections on a map to make comparison possible. The main function is `guess_projection` which creates the map with different options. The `reproject_points` function can be useful as well, as it supports reprojection of coordinate columns in a `data.frame`.

## Aim

The aim is to quickly check the coordinate system by plotting the coordinates on a leaflet map with a list of given coordinate systems.

## Functionality

### Dependencies

In order to run the functionalities, some R packags need to be installed. The set of required libraries is given on top of the R-script:

```R
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(dplyr)
library(leaflet)
library(assertthat)
```

Installing these packages can be done with the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("sp", "rgdal", "dplyr", "leaflet", "assertthat"))
```

### Projection function

The main R function is called `guess_projection`. As this is not (yet) available as an R package, making the function available can be done by sourcing the file (either in another script or in the R Console):

```R
source("guess_projection.R")
```

By doing so, the function `guess_projection` can be used. The `guess_projection` function requires as minimal inputs:

1.  a `data.frame`
2.  the longitude column name
3.  the latitude column name. 

For example:

```R
# my_dataframe has the columns "longitude" and "latitude"
guess_projection(my_dataframe, "longitude", "latitude")
```

Furthermore, the optional argument `belgium` is a boolean value (TRUE/FALSE) defining if the data is expectd to be in Belgium. Finally, the `epsg` codes of the corresponding coordinate systems to check can be customised. 

By default, the following CRS-systems are tested:

* `epsg:4326`
* `epsg:31370`
* `epsg:28992`
* `epsg:32631`
* `epsg:3812`
* `epsg:3035`

Which can be overridden by adapting the `projections` argument:

```R
guess_projection <- function(my_dataframe, "longitude", "latitude", belgium = TRUE, projections=c("EPSG:2000", "EPSG:2001"))
```
